# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a nostalgic game we all have played  with our friends.
This game refreshes our memory of the childhood. Since in lockdown, we all are restricted to our homes, so I have made this game to play with computer. The rule are quite simple.

You just need to type the number corresponding to every character and press Enter.

Rules:
1) Rock wins over Scissor but loses to Paper.
2) Paper wins over Rock but loses to Scissor.
3) Scissor wins over Paper but loses to Rock.
